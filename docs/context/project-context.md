# Project Context

## Purpose

The shortest static baseline an AI agent needs before doing useful work: identity, documentation freshness, technical stack, and verification commands.

Update it in place. Do not create dated copies.

This file intentionally does **not** track "what is being worked on right now". That is found by scanning unfinished plans in `docs/plans/`. Keeping high-churn active-work state here makes the file hard to maintain and prone to staleness.

## Project Identity

- Project name: todb
- Product type: Distributed database (LSM-based storage engine)
- Primary users: Database developers and researchers
- Documentation freshness: `fresh`

**Freshness gating:**

- If freshness is `stale` or `unknown`, agents may research, audit, and draft alignment docs, but must not implement product behavior until the baseline is re-established or a human confirms intended behavior.
- If freshness is `partially stale`, agents may implement only slices whose requirement, owner doc, codebase-map route, and touched code area have been verified fresh; otherwise treat the slice as `plan-first` or `research-only`.
- AI may not mark stale docs fresh without human confirmation or human-approved owner-doc evidence.

## Current Technical Baseline

- Frontend stack: N/A (database engine, no frontend)
- Backend stack: Rust (edition 2024), Tokio async runtime, DataFusion SQL engine
- Database/model source: Custom LSM storage engine with WAL and replication groups

## Verification Commands

Replace every placeholder before implementation work starts.

| Purpose                   | Command                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Install dependencies      | `cargo fetch`                 |
| Run app locally           | `cargo run --bin server`      |
| Typecheck / compile check | `cargo check --all-targets`   |
| Build                     | `cargo build --workspace`     |
| Lint / static check       | `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` |
| Unit tests                | `cargo test --workspace`      |
| E2E / integration tests   | `cargo test --test '*' --workspace` |

## AI Block Conditions

AI MUST stop and wait for human input before proceeding when:

- verification commands are all placeholders and cannot be inferred from the project
- any change touches payment or data-deletion paths with no existing test coverage and no owner doc describing expected behavior
- no requirement or owner doc describes the intended behavior of the change — do not implement into a vacuum (this replaces the old "active requirement is none" gate; whether a requirement/owner doc exists is checked against `docs/requirements/` and `docs/design/`, not a field here)

These are project-specific hard stops in addition to `AGENTS.md`, `docs/context/ai-autonomy-policy.md`, source-of-truth conflict rules, and required plan/closure audit rules.

For ambiguity that does not affect user-visible behavior, contracts, protected areas, or closure evidence, resolve by writing assumptions into the relevant doc and proceed according to the autonomy policy. Mark uncertain assumptions explicitly so humans can review later.

## Notes For AI Agents

- If this file is empty or stale, ask for or create a context update before large implementation work.
- **Current work in progress**: inspect unfinished plans in `docs/plans/`, not this file.
- AI autonomy defaults to `implement`; it is gated by freshness (above) and Protected Areas (`ai-autonomy-policy.md`). No per-slice autonomy value is maintained here — autonomy labels live on backlog/roadmap work items, not in this file.
- AI may correct factual context from live repo evidence, but must not mark stale docs fresh or downgrade protected areas without human confirmation.
- Do not report verification success while commands still contain `<fill real command>` placeholders.
